# Including Moonshot-based tooling in your project

## Create a Ruby wrapper

Now, let's create a ruby wrapper that implements the Moonshot tool and makes your CLI.
The base class is a subclass of Thor, so you can extend it using the [full Thor extensibility](http://whatisthor.com/). Here's a basic example using all the defaults:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'moonshot'

# Set up Moonshot tooling for our environment.
class MyService < Moonshot::CLI
  self.application_name = 'my-service'
  self.artifact_repository = S3Bucket.new('my-service-builds')
  self.build_mechanism = Script.new('build/script.sh')
  self.deployment_mechanism = CodeDeploy.new(asg: 'AutoScalingGroup')
end

MyService.start
```

This example assumes:
- You have a CloudFormation JSON template in folder called "cloud_formation/my-service.json".
- You have an S3 bucket called "my-service-builds".
- You have a script in "script/build.sh" that will build a tarball output.tar.gz.
- You have a working CodeDeploy setup, including the CodeDeployRole.

If all that is true, you can now deploy your software to a new stack with:
```
$ ./bin/environment create
```

By default, you'll get a development environment named `my-service-dev-giraffe`,
where `giraffe` is your username. If you want to provision test or production
named environment, use:
```
$ ./bin/environment create -n my-service-staging
$ ./bin/environment create -n my-service-production
```

By default, create launches the stack and deploys code. If you want to only
create the stack and not deploy code, use:
```
$ ./bin/environment create --no-deploy
```

If you make changes to your application and want to release a development build
to your stack, run:
```
$ ./bin/environment deploy-code
```

To build a "named build" for releasing through test and production environments,
use:
```
$ ./bin/environment build-version v0.1.0
$ ./bin/environment deploy-version v0.1.0 -n <environment-name>
```

We recommend using a CI system like Jenkins to perform those activities, for
consistency.
